      <p>
        My name is Jacob Bassett and I am a full stack web developer. I have found myself on this path from a love of problem solving using engineering practices. I have a background in welding from my high school and combat medicine from my time in the U.S. Army. I left these fields because I have a passion for technology and decided to make it part of my career.
